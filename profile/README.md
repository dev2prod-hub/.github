# ðŸš€ Dev2Prod Hub


The main idea of the platform is: to help developers focus on their work by eliminating distractions such as delivery and other interruptions.

1. Developer create a YAML  config file in the root of the project.
2. The platform will read the config file and take care about CI/CD, Observability, Security, etc.
