# ðŸš€ Dev2Prod Hub


Main idea: Platform to focus of the development to get rid of the delivery and other distractions.
I need some coming soon page to start to collect emails.

1. Developer create a YAML  config file in the root of the project.
2. The platform will read the config file and take care about CI/CD, Observability, Security, etc.
